A blogging engine built on Ruby on Rails. It's specifically built for my personal site, http://benovermyer.com, though with a bit of tweaking on the visual side can be used for any blog site.

Obelisk is very minimalistic. It supports posts, but not pages. It assumes that it will only be used as a blog, not a CMS. In this, it serves a singular purpose.
